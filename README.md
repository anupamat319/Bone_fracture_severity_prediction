✨✨ I built an AI system that predicts bone fracture severity in seconds. ✨✨

This is a real-time clinical decision support tool where users enter patient and injury details, and the system predicts whether a fracture is Mild, Moderate, or Severe — using structured clinical and report-based inputs.

🩺 What this system does:
 🔹 One-click fracture severity prediction (Mild/Moderate/Severe)
 🔹 downloadable professional PDF report
 🔹 Clear patient & injury summary, ready to share
 🟦 Interactive dashboard with three different fracture severity cases
 📄 PDF diagnostic reports generated for each case
